C++ Project exercise 3

In this exercise, we will be obtaining keyboard input events. We want the engine to implement the following functions:
	
	//time difference in milliseconds since last update
	int deltatime();
	
	//number of game ticks since the start of the program
	int ticks();
	

Create a program that reads the virtual scancode of the character pressed on the client and sends it to the server. The server echoes the message back to the client.

At the end of creating the code, make a program that TESTS the functions, that you can use later!

int main(){
	//test wait
	//test deltatime
	//test update
	//test ticks
	
	//show an error message if the expected behaviour does not happen!
	
	//end of program
	return 0;
}

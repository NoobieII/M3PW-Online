M3PW Project - Part 2
September 6-8, 2020 - Draft 1

After finishing that quest involving picking up the human goods, the old fur you were talking to says:
if you haven't finished yet,
-d00 We could use a little more than what you have brought. Don't look at me like that! Everyone else is moving what we have up north.

if you have finished
-d00 Ah good work, it looks like you've gotten what we need. Go back to where you came from. Your mom should be able to fly you to the new encampment. (d01)
-d01 Hmm... For being a good kid, I suppose you can keep one of these pieces from the humans. We've already seen them in the past.
    (Pick an article of armour. There is a lobster tail helmet, gauntlets and a round shield.)

You head back the way you came from when your mother took you and your siblings outside. The path you and your mother took was a one-way path and you can't return back up the rocky hill yourself.

There is someone standing at this rocky hill bottom. (He functions similarly to the man in the dinosaur suit in Cave Story). He will not give the player any items or quests but may give insight about the area you are currently in.

-d00 You came from up there? Better think twice before jumping down ledges. (d01)
-d01 Maybe you should tag along with the other fellow dragons.

You find a male crow-looking guy standing on the same map where you encountered the human. He acts as a transportation service. (He is related to an alcoholic crow man I wrote about in 2017.) If you talk to him, he says:

-d00 Mmm... You say you need to go somewhere? I can take you to many places! (r01, r02)
-r01 Nah, I'm sorry. I don't take ride from strangers.
-r02 Booyah! (d01)
-d01 I can take you to the new encampment. Hold onto my rope!

You take a journey up through the forest

In the new encampment, there are "buildings" (I put it in quotes because animals don't make buildings yet!), primarily with dragons living in them. On one of the map screens, a big fire burns strongly. The same old fur who gave you the piece of armour is standing there.

-d00 This fire commemorates the tragedy we've just faced and it marks our war against humans. (r01, r02)
-r01 I understand... (d02)
-r02 Wait, what tragedy? (d01)
-d01 ... Well, we lost the area we used to live in to the humans. They're most likely meddling in the area now. (d02)
-d02 This fire will burn for about 100 years with the material that it is made of. It is only possible to dowse the flame but not to extinguish it, as it is a chemical fire, to be specific.

There is a rather conscription-like school that you will eventually enter upon browsing through the town. Upon entering, you will get pulled into class. You are in a makeshift classroom. The teacher is a big western dragon wearing eyeglasses, sitting on a small stool.
-d00 ATTENNNN-SHUN! Welcome to your first day of school. (d01)
-d01 On the left we have a whole selection of toys that we have engineered into your curriculum. (d02)
-d03 On the right are some picture books tailored to comply with our government regulations. In the middle you have me. (d04)
-d04 Dig in, everyone!
    (The students all scramble, avoiding the teacher in the middle.)

You are free to roam around the classroom. Now is a chance to talk to some classmates (or attack them). However, all of the toys and books are being used by other kids. If you talk to the teacher, you will get a long story about about his infiltration in a human society (to be written in detail later) [INCOMPLETE].

The teacher starts talking.
-d00 It is time for us to sing our ABC's. You start, four-eyes.
    (Each kid takes turns saying the next letter in the alphabet.)

-d24 Nicely done. You pass the first day of class. (d25)
-d25 Umm, yeah. So I have been given word that we need to be picking up the pace. (d26)
-d26 There will be quite a test. Be prepared in all ways and forms. Class dismissed!

You find a rabbit hole one map screen west of the encampment. A vulpine-looking dude is standing outside of it.
-d00 Whenever the old rabbit is gone, his wife takes over. She breathes fire, so don't piss her off! (r01, r02)
-r01 Yo! Where are your manners?
-r02 Thanks for the tip! (d01)
-d01 No problem! They call me Franku.

It appears to have been there for a long time. Inside is a library. Fortunately, the male rabbit is there. He looks after all the records in the library.
-d00 Hey kid. I'm really sorry to say, but we don't have picture books here. (r01, r02, r03, r04)
-r01 What do people look for in this place? (d01)
-r02 Well shucks!
-r03 I'm looking for something that will make me pass a test. (d10)
-r04 I'd like to submit my own work! (d??) [INCOMPLETE]
-d01 This place is a collection of everything that has ever been written. (d02)
-d02 Donated by the ones who were willing to, of course. (d03)
-d03 You can find things from cooking a tasty... gulp... rabbit stew... to the famous dragons and dragonesses. (d04)
-d04 You might like the latter one. The only reason I keep the first one is all in the name of knowledge. (d05)
-d05 Unfortunately for you, we don't have a children section but we have an adult section that you can look at at your own risk. (d06)
-d06 Just promise me one thing. Don't take out anything that belongs here.
-d10 A test. You don't know what's being tested eh? (d11)
-d11 The best I can think of is to check the section about supernatural powers. (d12)
-d12 Honestly, that would be the only way to beat whatever your teacher will throw at you!

This is all that I can write for now. In the next issue, I will write about the impossibly hard test that will require intelligence and physical strength. It is intentional that all questions are not possible to be answered by a single person. I will be reaching out to several people to come up with some. I might write some myself! The player will have to gain a few levels and learn at least one compatible skill to acquire the answers in the test. Also, the NPC's will all have their own name in the future.

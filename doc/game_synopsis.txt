The goal of this game is to make the player have a more insightful technical mindset after playing. The target audience is older teens and adults, with and without technical knowledge.

The gamepley will have a top-down perspective, similar to some popular games like the Legend of Zelda or Runescape. The game will have combat mechanics similar to those of Runescape or Ragnarok Online. The game will be a multiplayer RPG.

GAMEPLAY EXAMPLES

Dragons learn special abilities after reaching a certain level and by talking to the NPC (non playable character) who teaches the ability. For example, there is a village of foxes, west of the town where you are raised. One of the foxes teach you how to shoot fire.

One NPC named Yoku is cynical and wants to leave the world. She takes it literally and gets the idea of shooting herself out of Earth's atmosphere and never coming back. She has built a mechanism that can launch her as high as she would like, given a source of energy. Here, the player can learn about escape velocity and the energy needed.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE

The gameplay is still being written. The game has been in this early stage of development for five years.

Current Required Use Cases - December 14, 2020

I am planning on implementing the following features in the game:

In the menu screen, the player can:
    -Log in
    -Create account

In the map, the player can:
    -Fly
    -Move
    -Change map

If something is missing or you have any recommendations, please let me know!

Detailed Use Cases

Fly:
    -Player presses SPACE
    -Player's drag (resistance to movement) is set to low value
    -Player lifts above ground
    -Player's fly energy gets used up while above ground
    -Player lets go of SPACE
    -Player falls back to ground
    -Player's drag set to normal value
    -If the player lands in a hazard within the map (e.g. a pool of water),
     <Scenario 1>
    -If the player lands in an outer hazard (e.g. the edge of a cliff),
     <Scenario 2>
     
    Scenario 1:
        The player will be lose HP and will be placed on the last position the

Fire Breathing Rabbit

1.
You lost my book? How so?

2. (Franku)
Some foxes took it away from me and destroyed it.

3.
Well... in the end, you still lost it.

4. (Franku)
So... you mean it is over?

5.
No, Franku, of course not.

6.
Unlike most foxes your age, you show a great interest in the books that I brought to this library.

7.
I wouldn't ever think of banning you from my library.

8.
However,

9.
You let them take away the book so I think you should find someone who can teach you how to fight.

10.
Look at me, I'm a fire breathing rabbit!

11.
Go see the old fire fox in the heart of our village. I'll give your dragon friend permission to enter the village.

12.
Your name's $PLAYERNAME? Ah, it's nice to meet you.

13.
Thanks for trying to help me and Franku recover the book.

You should be able to enter the foxes' village now.

This place is a collection of everything that has ever been written. All donated books.

You can find things from tasty rabbit stews to famous dragons and dragonesses. You might like the latter one.

I keep these all for the sake of knowledge. Just don't take anything without my knowing.

Idiots... What idiots! They took my book away from me. It's not my book either. It's the librarian's. I'll probably get banned if I don't return it, like those foxes already.

>I'll help you get the book (go to 3)
 You're on your own

The book? It's gone? Idiots...

I'll be at the rabbit hole library.

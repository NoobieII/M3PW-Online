Crow [Mother Dragon Cave] NPC

1.
Thank goodness, a dragon!

2.
Our drunken crow has gotten caught up with the foxes again and they won't leave him alone.

3.
To be honest, though, I think he's kind of dumb. Wait, don't tell him I said that!

4.
Could you help one of us fellow crows? We promise to repay you.

>Yes (go to 5)
 No  (go to 6)

5.
Thank you! Please kill 3 foxes and come back when you're done!

*******************

6.
Alright, sorry for bugging you.

7.
Aye, you did a good job fending off those foxes.

8.
...By fending off, I mean killing! ...

9.
I'm the youngest of the crows. I can take you to places.

10.
Where'd you like to go?

Off we go!

Centipede Train NPC

1.
Hi, I'm train #1001. Have I been running satisfactorily?

>Yes (go to 2)
 No

*******************

2.
I'm glad to hear that.

3.
Is there something that you need?

>I've lost something                           (go to 4)
 Is there something that I can learn from you? (go to 6)
 No thanks

4.
You've lost something? Here are some things that I've picked from the ground.

>[Items] (go to 5)
 Cancel

*******************

5.
Here you go.

*******************

6. (condition: player is a fire/ice/poison dragon. else go to 7)
Hmm... You seem to know a lot already. There's nothing I have to teach you.

*******************

7.
Hmm... What do I know?

8.
Hmm... All I really do is move from one place to another? When I retire, I'll be put to rest.

>Where did you come from? (go to 9)
 Never mind

*******************

9.
Hmm... Sorry it's taking a while... I don't quite know?

>What's your name? (go to 10)
 Never mind

*******************

10.
What's my name? it's #1001? Your name? $PLAYERNAME sounds like a nice name.

11.
You tell me that you want to learn something from me? I suppose we know how to keep a strong stance against obstacles.

12.
Unfortunately my schedule is set in stone, but you can maybe talk to another centipede during their final moments before retirement.

13.
Keep an eye out for #1023. You'll find him at the scrapyard at 10pm UTC.

14.
Nice talking with you. See you later, hopefully.
